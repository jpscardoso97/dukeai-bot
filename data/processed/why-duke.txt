The Duke Difference: AI and Machine Learning 

Why join Duke AI?
Duke's AI Master of Engineering develops technical leaders who are equipped to build our future through AI and machine learning. Students build strong technical skills together with an understanding of how to design and build software products, positioning them to build new AI products and systems that solve the challenging problems our world faces.  
Our unique program differentiates itself through:
A strong focus on applied machine learning and MLOps to solve real-world problems
An experiential model of education where students learn by doing, building a portfolio of personal and team projects to show potential employers
A heavy emphasis on industry collaboration, with students engaging with industry leaders during their capstone projects, industry seminars, and internships
A small, intimate cohort and emphasis on small class sizes and close interaction between students and our leading faculty
We welcome Diverse participants
The Duke AI program is designed for engineers and scientists from all regions of the world with a variety of technical and scientific backgrounds. We intentionally cultivate a diverse group of students passionate about several different fields and industries. Roughly half of our students join the program directly after their undergraduate studies, and the other half join after gaining work experience.
Many students enter the program with a strong prior background in programming or software development, while others enter with less programming experience but stronger domain-specific expertise. The unique design of our program accommodates both types of participants.
